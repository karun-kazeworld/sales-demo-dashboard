I wanted to understand your fleet operations and see if Castrol can support you better.\nCustomer: We operate around 100 trucks, mostly long-haul. Downtime is a big issue.\nSalesperson: Many long-haul fleets use Castrol CRB Turbomax because it performs well under heavy loads and protects engines during long runs.\nCustomer: We currently use Servo. Their pricing works for us.\nSalesperson: I understand price matters. CRB Turbomax is slightly premium, but it improves engine life overall.\nCustomer: How does that help me practically?\nSalesperson: Better engine protection usually means fewer breakdowns. Some customers have also seen mileage improvements.\nCustomer: I'm not convinced yet.\nSalesperson: Maybe you can try it on a few trucks.\nCustomer: Let's see.",

Instead of a full switch, would you be open to a controlled trial on 10 trucks to compare performance consistency?\nCustomer: Possibly. What about support during the trial?\nSalesperson: We can support monitoring during the trial period and review results together.\nCustomer: Let's discuss this further.",
